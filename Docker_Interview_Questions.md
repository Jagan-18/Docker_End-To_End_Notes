# Docker Interview Questions
---
# 1. What is docker?
- Docker is an open source containerization platform.
- It enables developers to package applications into lightweight, portable containers.
- Containers include everything an application needs to run—code, libraries, dependencies, and configuration files—making it easy to move across different environments.
  
**Key Benefits of Docker:**

**• Portability:** Containers can run across any system that has Docker installed.

**• Lightweight:** Containers are much smaller than virtual machines (VMs) because they share the host system's OS kernel.

**• Scalability:** Docker makes it easy to scale applications by running multiple instances of containers.

 # 2. How Container are different from the virtual machines?  (OR)  Docker vs. Virtualization

  | **Containers**                                                                      | **Virtual Machines**                                |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
|1. Lightweight: Containers Share the host OS kernel and run in isolated environments   | 1. Heavy weight: Each VM includes a full OS and runs on a hypervisor. |
| More efficient; only the application and its dependencies are packaged.               | Less efficient; each VM includes an entire OS.       |
| Better performance due to lower overhead.                                             | Slower performance due to the OS overhead.           |
| Faster Startup (Seconds)                                                               | Slower startup (Minutes)                             | 
| Provides process-level isolation.                                                      | Provides strong isolation with a separate OS.       |
