# Docker Interview Questions

# 1. What is docker?
- Docker is an open source containerization platform.
- It enables developers to package applications into lightweight, portable containers.
- Containers include everything an application needs to run—code, libraries, dependencies, and configuration files—making it easy to move across different environments.
  
**Key Benefits of Docker:**

**• Portability:** Containers can run across any system that has Docker installed.

**• Lightweight:** Containers are much smaller than virtual machines (VMs) because they share the host system's OS kernel.

**• Scalability:** Docker makes it easy to scale applications by running multiple instances of containers.
