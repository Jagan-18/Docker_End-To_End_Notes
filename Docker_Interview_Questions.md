# Docker Interview Questions
---
# 1. What is docker?
- Docker is an open source containerization platform.
- It enables developers to package applications into lightweight, portable containers.
- Containers include everything an application needs to run—code, libraries, dependencies, and configuration files—making it easy to move across different environments.
  
**Key Benefits of Docker:**

**• Portability:** Containers can run across any system that has Docker installed.

**• Lightweight:** Containers are much smaller than virtual machines (VMs) because they share the host system's OS kernel.

**• Scalability:** Docker makes it easy to scale applications by running multiple instances of containers.

---
 # 2. How Container are different from the virtual machines?  (OR)  Docker vs. Virtualization

| **Containers**                                                                         | **Virtual Machines**                                                  |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Lightweight: Containers Share the host OS kernel and run in isolated environments   | 1. Heavy weight: Each VM includes a full OS and runs on a hypervisor. |
| 2. More efficient; only the application and its dependencies are packaged.             | 2. Less efficient; each VM includes an entire OS.                     |
| 3. Better performance due to lower overhead.                                           | 3.  Slower performance due to the OS overhead.                        |
| 4. Faster Startup (Seconds)                                                            | 4. Slower startup (Minutes)                                           | 
| 5. Provides process-level isolation.                                                   | 5. Provides strong isolation with a separate OS.                      |

# 3.what is docker lifecycle ?
- In my case, the Docker lifecycle process typically starts with writing a Dockerfile. For example, if a developer comes to me with a requirement to containerize an application,

1. **Write the Dockerfile**:  
   - When a requirement comes in to containerize an application, I start by writing a **Dockerfile**. This file contains the instructions needed to set up the environment and run the application.

2. **Build the Docker Image**:  
   - After the Dockerfile is complete, I use the **docker build** command to create a **Docker image** from the Dockerfile.

3. **Run the Docker Container**:  
   - Once the image is built, I use the **docker run** command to create and run a **container** from the image. This starts the application inside the container.

4. **Push to a Registry**:  
   - Finally, if everything works well, I push the image to an external registry like **Docker Hub** or **Quay.io** using the **docker push** command. This allows the image to be shared and used for deployments.

- Docker images act as a instructions to build a docker container. It can be compared to a snapshot in a VM.
  
```bash
#  Builds Docker images from a Dockerfile.
docker build -t <image-name> .

#  To runs container from docker images (OR) Creates and starts a container from a Docker image.
docker run -d --name <container-name> <image-name>

-  -d: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background)

# push the container image to public/private regestries to share the docker images.
docker push <container-name>

# Lists all running containers.
docker ps

# Executes a command inside a running container. Commonly used to interact with the container's environment.
docker exec -it <container-name> <command>

- -it: Interactive terminal for running commands in the container.
```
---
# 4. Whar are the different types of docker components? or  Can you pls explane Docker Architecture and its components?
- Docker has a client-server architecture, which consists of several key components that work together to enable containerization.

### **Docker Architecture and Components**:

1. **Docker Client**:

   - The Docker Client is the interface used to interact with Docker. It sends commands to the Docker Daemon (server) to perform tasks like building, running, and managing containers. Common Docker commands are executed here, such as docker run, docker build, and docker push

2. **Docker Daemon (Docker Engine)**:
   - The Docker Daemon is responsible for managing Docker containers, images, networks, and volumes. It listens for Docker API requests and performs actions like building images, running containers, and managing Docker objects.
     
   - It is often referred to as docker engine and runs in the background.

3. **Docker Images**:
   - A Docker image is a read-only template that contains instructions for creating a container. Images are built from Dockerfiles.

4. **Docker Containers**:
   - Containers are running instances of Docker images. They are isolated environments where your application runs. They share the host OS kernel but are separate from each other.

5. **Docker Registry**:
   - A **Registry** is where Docker images are stored. **Docker Hub** is the most popular public registry. You can push and pull images from registries to share and use them.

6. **Docker Volumes**:
   - Volumes are used to store data persistently, outside of containers. If a container is stopped or deleted, the data in a volume stays safe and can be reused by other containers.

7. **Docker Networks**:
   - Networks allow containers to communicate with each other. Docker automatically creates a network for containers, but you can also create custom networks for better control.
---
### **Summary**:
- **Docker Client**: The tool you use to interact with Docker.
- **Docker Daemon**: The server that handles Docker commands and runs containers.
- **Docker Images**: The templates that containers are created from.
- **Docker Containers**: The running instances of Docker images.
- **Docker Registry**: A place to store and share Docker images.
- **Docker Volumes**: Persistent storage for container data.
- **Docker Networks**: Allow containers to communicate with each other.

# 5. What is the difference between COPY and ADD in a Dockerfile?

|        **`docker COPY`**                                    |         **`docker ADD`**                                                                      |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Copies files/folders from the host to the container.     | 1. Copies files/folders from the host to the container, but with additional extracts archives |
| 2. Does not support URls                                    | 2. It can handle remote URLs as source paths and download files during the build.             |
| 3. Does **not** automatically extract tar files.            | 3. Automatically extracts tar files when (such as .tar, .tar.gz, .zip,etc)into the container. |                                           
| 4. More Secure and predictable.                             | 4. Less Secure (Due to extraction & Remote fetch)                                             |


### **When to Use Each**:
- **Use `docker COPY`** when you only need to copy files from your local machine into the container. It’s simpler and more predictable.
- **Use `docker ADD`** when you need extra functionality, like copying from a remote URL or extracting tar files automatically.

# 6. What is difference between CMD and ENTERPOINT?

| **`CMD`**                                                                      | **`ENTRYPOINT`**                                                                               |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Provides default arguments for the container when no command is specified.  | 1. Defines the main command to run when the container starts.                                  |
| 2.  Can be overridden by command-line arguments when running the container.    | 2. Cannot be fully overridden (can append args) unless --entrypoint is specified               |
| 3. Typically used to provide default arguments or commands.                    | 3. Used to set the main executable for the container.                                          |
| 4. Can be combined with `ENTRYPOINT` to provide default arguments.             | 4. Can be combined with `CMD` to pass default arguments to the `ENTRYPOINT`.                   |
| 5. `CMD ["echo", "Hello World"]`                                               | 5. `ENTRYPOINT ["echo"]` (executes `echo` command)                                             |
(executes `echo` command with `"Hello World"` as argument)                       |

---
### **When to Use Each**:
- **Use `CMD`** when you want to provide default arguments that can be easily overridden at runtime.
- **Use `ENTRYPOINT`** when you want to set the main command that should always run, and optionally provide default arguments via `CMD`.
---
### **Example:**: **Using `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` together**:
```dockerfile
  ENTRYPOINT ["echo"]
  CMD ["Hello World"]
 ```
- If no arguments are passed, this runs `echo Hello World`. If arguments are provided at runtime **(e.g., `docker run <container> Goodbye`)**,
  it runs **`echo Goodbye`**.
---
 # 7.what are the networking types in docker and what is the default?
- Docker Networking is the way Docker containers connect and communicate with each other, the host machine, and external networks. It allows containers to send and receive data through different types of networks, ensuring smooth interaction between services within Docker.
1. **Bridge** (Default)  
   - The default network type. Containers are connected to a private internal network, and they communicate with each other via this network.

2. **Host**  
   - The container shares the network namespace with the host system, which means it uses the host’s IP address and can access the network directly.

3. **None**  
   - The container has no network access. It cannot connect to any network, including the host network.

4. **Overlay**  
   - Used in Docker Swarm for communication between containers running on different Docker hosts in a cluster.

5. **Macvlan**  
   - Allows containers to have their own MAC address, making them appear as physical devices on the network.

---

### **Default Networking Type**  
- **Bridge** is the default networking type in Docker.

---
# 8. How to Isolate Networking Between Docker Containers
- To isolate networking between Docker containers, By using custom networks, the `none` driver, and network policies, you can effectively isolate Docker containers from each other to ensure security and control over traffic flow.

1. **Use Separate Networks for Containers**
   - You can create custom Docker networks and assign containers to different networks, preventing them from communicating with containers on other networks.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     docker network create network1
     docker network create network2
     docker run --network network1 mycontainer1
     docker run --network network2 mycontainer2
     ```
     In this case, containers on `network1` cannot communicate with containers on `network2`.

2. **Use the `none` Network Driver**
   - The `none` driver completely isolates the container from any network. This is useful if you want to ensure that a container cannot access any network.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     docker run --network none mycontainer
     ```

3. **Use Docker Compose with Network Configuration**
   - In **Docker Compose**, you can define separate networks for different services to isolate them from one another.
   - Example in `docker-compose.yml`:
     ```yaml
     version: '3'
     services:
       app1:
         image: app1_image
         networks:
           - network1
       app2:
         image: app2_image
         networks:
           - network2

     networks:
       network1:
       network2:
     ```

4. **Network Policies (for Kubernetes)**
   - If you're using **Kubernetes**, you can apply network policies to control traffic between pods, ensuring isolation between them.

---

# 9. What is a Multi-Stage Docker Build?
- A multi-stage Docker build is a process where you use multiple **FROM statements** in a single Dockerfile to create a more efficient image by separating the build process into different stages.
  
- This helps you to reduce the final image size by eliminating unnecessary build dependencies from the final image.
  
#### How Multi-Stage Builds Work:
1. The **first stage (build stage)** includes all the dependencies required for building the application (e.g., compilers, libraries, and other build tools).
2. The **second stage (runtime stage)** is the final image that only includes the runtime environment needed to execute the app.

- In the final image, only the files explicitly copied from the build stage will be included, leaving behind all unnecessary build tools and intermediate files.

#### Example of Multi-Stage Build:
```bash
# Stage 1: Build Stage
FROM node:16 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Runtime Stage
FROM node:16-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/build /app
RUN npm install --only=production
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```
- **Stage 1 (builder):** The image starts with a full Node.js image (node:16), installs dependencies, and builds the app.
- **Stage 2 (runtime):** The final image is based on a smaller image (node:16-slim), and it only includes the built application and necessary runtime dependencies.
  
This approach reduces the final image size by omitting build tools and other unnecessary files, which are only needed during the build process.

---
# 10. How to Reduce the Size of Your Docker Image? 
- Reducing the size of Docker images helps in faster builds, quicker deployments, and more efficient resource usage.

1. **Use Multi-Stage Builds**: Separate the build and runtime stages to include only necessary files in the final image.
2. **Choose Smaller Base Images**: Start with lightweight images like `alpine` instead of larger ones like `ubuntu`.
3. **Remove Unnecessary Files**: Clean up package manager caches and temporary files.
4. **Minimize Layers**: Combine multiple `RUN` commands into one to reduce image layers.
5. **Use `.dockerignore`**: Exclude unnecessary files from being added to the image.

---

# 11. What are Dangling Images in Docker?
Dangling images are images that no longer have a tag or are not associated with any containers. These images are leftover from the process of building or updating images but are not in use anymore.

- You can list dangling images by using the following command:
  ```bash
  docker images -f "dangling=true"
  ```
-This will remove all dangling images and free up disk space. and This will show you all the images that are untagged and not used.
```bash
docker image prune
```
(OR) - This will remove all dangling images. If you want to remove all unused images (not just dangling ones), you can use:
```bash
docker image prune -a
```
---

### 12 Difference Between Dangling and Unused Images
**Dangling images:**
- These are not tagged and not associated with any containers.
  
- They often represent layers from previous builds that are no longer in use.
  
- Can be removed using **docker image prune**.
  
 **Unused images:**
  - These are images that are not currently in use by any container (i.e., no running container is using them).
    
- They might still be tagged.
  
- Can be removed manually or by running **docker image prune -a**.
---

# 13. What are Distro-less Images in Docker?

**Distro-less images** are minimal Docker images that contain only the application and its dependencies, without any operating system (OS) or package manager. These images are designed to be as small and efficient as possible by eliminating the unnecessary parts of a traditional base image.

### **Key Characteristics:**
- They contain only the **essential runtime** required for the application to run.
- **No package manager**, shell, or other utilities typically found in full OS images.
- They help **reduce the attack surface**, improve security, and minimize image size.

---
# 14. Can you pls explain Realtime challenges  with docker ?

1. **Single Point of Failure (Docker Daemon)**  
   Docker relies on a single daemon process to manage containers. If the Docker daemon fails or crashes, it can cause all running containers and applications to go down, leading to a single point of failure.

2. **Security Risks (Root User)**  
   Docker daemon runs with root privileges, which poses a security risk. If an attacker compromises the Docker daemon, they can potentially gain control over the entire system. This is a critical security concern because any process running as root can have wide-reaching effects.

3. **Resource Constraints**  
   Running too many containers on a single host can lead to resource constraints such as CPU, memory, and storage. This can cause containers to slow down or even crash, affecting application performance and availability.
---

# 15. what are the step you take the to secure the conatiners

1. **Use Minimal or Distroless Images:-** Start with minimal base images or distroless images in multi-stage builds to reduce the attack surface by minimizing unnecessary packages.

2. **Proper Networking Configuration:-** Ensure proper container networking. Configure custom bridge networks or isolated networks to prevent unnecessary container communication and potential security breaches.

3. **Image Scanning:-** Use security scanning tools like **Docker Scan**, **Trivy**, or third-party utilities (e.g., **Aqua Security**) to check container images for vulnerabilities and security risks.
   
**(OR)**

1. Always use **small, minimal base images** (like Alpine) to reduce the attack surface. The fewer components there are, the fewer potential vulnerabilities you have.
2. **Avoid Running as Root (Use Non-Root User)**:- Never run your container as the **root** user. Instead, create a non-root user and run the container with that user to limit privileges.
3. **Use Signed Images (Docker Content Trust)**:- Enable **Docker Content Trust (DCT)** to ensure you are using **signed images**. This helps verify the authenticity and integrity of images.
4. Regularly scan your Docker images for **security vulnerabilities** using tools like **Docker Scan**.
---

# 16. What are Bind Mounts in Docker?

- Bind Mounts in Docker allow you to mount a file or directory from the host system into a container. Unlike volumes, which are managed by Docker, bind mounts directly map a file or directory on the host to a location inside the container.

- This means that changes made to the file or directory in the container will reflect directly on the host system and vice versa. Bind mounts are typically used when you need to persist data or share files between the host and containers.

# Volumes vs Bind Mounts in Docker
 
|          **Volumes**                                                                        |                  **Bind Mounts**                                                              |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Volumes are managed by Docker and stored in Docker's default directory on the host system.  | Bind mounts are mapped directly from the host's filesystem to the container.                  |
| Stored in Docker's `/var/lib/docker/volumes` (by default).                                  | Can be anywhere on the host system (e.g., `/home/user/data`).                                 |
| Docker optimizes volumes for performance.                                                   | Performance may depend on the host's filesystem.                                              |
| Volumes can be easily backed up, restored, and shared between containers.                   | Requires manual backup and restoration since it uses the host’s filesystem.                   |
| Preferred when you want Docker to manage data or share data between containers.             | Useful for linking host-specific files or directories to containers (e.g., for config files). |
| Volumes are more secure as Docker controls access.                                          | Can expose host files to containers, which may create security risks.                         |

---
# 17 What is Docker Compose?
- **Docker Compose** is a tool used for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Docker Compose, you can define all the services (containers) your application needs in a single YAML file, typically named `docker-compose.yml`.

- Using a single command (`docker-compose up`), Docker Compose allows you to start, stop, and manage multiple containers at once, making it easy to handle complex applications that require several services, such as databases, web servers, and caches.
---

# 18 how do you persist data in docker cotainers?
To persist data in Docker, I would use **Docker Volumes**,**Bind Mounts**, or **tmpfs Mounts,** depending on the use case. These options help keep data persistent beyond the container's lifecycle, and they are easy to manage and share across containers.
1. **Docker Volumes** (Recommended):
   - **Create a volume**: `docker volume create my_volume`
   - **Mount the volume**: `docker run -v my_volume:/data my_image`
   - Volumes are managed by Docker, persist even if the container is removed, and are easy to back up.

2. **Bind Mounts** (Alternative):
   - **Mount a host directory**: (-v /host/path:/container/path)
        `docker run -v /path/on/host:/data my_image`
   - Bind mounts are tied to the host system, useful for directly accessing data.

3. Use **tmpfs** mounts for non-persistent data.
   -  `docker run --mount type=tmpfs,destination=/data my_image`
   -  tmpfs mounts are stored in memory and are used for non-persistent, temporary data that does not need to be stored after the container stops.

**Summary:**-  **Volumes** are the preferred method for persistence, **Bind Mounts** for direct host access, and **tmpfs** for temporary data stored in memory
---

# 19. How do you troubleshoot a failing docker container? (OR) How do you debug a containner crash?
When a Docker container fails, there are several steps you can take to troubleshoot and identify the issue.
1. Check container logs with  `docker logs <container_id>`
2. Inspect the container's status using `docker ps -a`
3. Inspect the container's configuration `docker inspect <container_id>`
4. check running processes `docker top <container_id>`
5. Run in interactive mode `docker run -it <image> /bin/sh`
6. Check resource utilization using `docker stats`
7. Verify Dockerfile/configurations for missing dependencies or errors.
---

# 20 How do you clean up unused docker resources?
1. Remove stopped containers: `docker rm$(docker ps -aq)`
  - **Note:** If you only want to remove stopped containers, the `docker container prune` command
2. Remove unused images: `docker rmi $(docker images -q)` or (`docker image prune -a` for all unused images).
3. Remove unused volumes: `docker volume prune`
4. To clean up all unused containers, images, volumes, and networks, use: `docker system prune`
---

# 21. How do you limit container resources?
You can limit the resources (CPU, memory, etc.) available to a Docker container using various flags when starting the container.
1. **Limit CPU Usage**:- To limit the CPU shares (relative weight):
     `docker run --cpu-shares <value> <image_name>`
- To limit the number of CPU cores:-
     `docker run --cpus=<number_of_cpus> <image_name>`
2. **Limit Memory Usage**:- To set a memory limit:
     `docker run --memory=<memory_limit> <image_name>`
  
  Example:   **`docker run --memory=512m <image_name>`**
  
 - To set both memory and swap limit:
     `docker run --memory=<memory_limit> --memory-swap=<swap_limit> <image_name>`
3. **Limit Disk I/O**:- To limit the read/write rate for disk I/O:
     ` docker run --blkio-weight=<value> <image_name>`
4. **Limit Network Bandwidth**:- To limit the network bandwidth:
     `docker run --net-rate=<value> <image_name>`
---

# 22. How do you connect two docker containers?
To connect two Docker containers, the most common approach is to use **Docker networks**. By connecting both containers to the same network, they can communicate with each other.
1. **Create a Network** (if not already created):-  `docker network create my_network`
2. **Run Containers on the Same Network**:
   - When running the first container, connect it to the created network:
     `docker run --network my_network --name container1 <image_name>`
   - Then, run the second container on the same network:
     `docker run --network my_network --name container2 <image_name>`
3. **Communicate Between Containers**:
   - Once both containers are on the same network, they can communicate with each other by using the container names as hostnames.
   - For example, from **container1**, you can ping **container2** by using:
     `docker exec container1 ping container2`
---

# 23. What Happens When You Remove a Running Docker Container?
1. **The Container Stops**:- Removing a running container will automatically stop it.
2. **The Container is Deleted**:- The container is deleted from the system along with its settings and filesystem.
3. **Data Loss**:- Any data inside the container (not in a volume) will be lost.
4. **The Image Remains**:- The Docker image used to create the container is not affected and remains intact.
5. To remove a running container, you can use:-  `docker rm -f <container_name_or_id>`
      - This command forces the container to stop and then removes it.
---

# 24. How to Update a Running Docker Container Without Downtime?
To update a running Docker container without downtime, you can use strategies like **rolling updates** or **Blue-Green deployment**.
1. **Rolling Updates (using Docker Swarm or Docker Compose)**:
   - **Docker Swarm** allows you to update containers one by one, keeping the service available during the update.
       - Example command in Docker Swarm:-   `docker service update --image <new_image> <service_name>` 
   - **Docker Compose** can also be used to update the containers without downtime by rebuilding and restarting the services one at a time.
       - Example command:-  `docker-compose up -d --no-deps --build <service_name>`
2. **Blue-Green Deployment**:
   - In **Blue-Green Deployment**, you maintain two identical environments (Blue and Green). 
   - You run the updated version in the Green environment and switch the traffic from Blue to Green once everything is ready. This ensures no downtime.
   - After the switch, you can remove the Blue environment.
### **Summary**:
- **Rolling Updates** (Docker Swarm or Compose) allow containers to be updated one by one with minimal or no downtime.
- **Blue-Green Deployment** is another strategy that avoids downtime by switching between two environments.

# 26. How to Run a Docker Container in the Background?
To run a Docker container in the background, you can use the **-d (detached) flag** with the docker run command. This will start the container in detached mode, meaning it runs in the background without blocking your terminal.
```bash
docker run -d <image_name>

docker run -d --name my_container <myimage>
(or)
docker run -d --name my_container nginx
```

# 26. what is the difference between Docker Image and Docker Container.?
 |             **Docker Image**                                               |            **Docker Container**                                                 |
 |----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | A Docker image is a **read-only template** used to create containers.      | A Docker container is a **running instance** of a Docker image.                 |
 | **Immutable (Read-only)**                                                  | **Mutable (Writable)**                                                          |
 | Used to package and distribute an application along with its dependencies. | Runs the application based on the image and allows changes during runtime.      |
 | Exists as long as it’s stored in a registry or locally.                    | Exists only while it’s running. It can be started, stopped, and removed.        |
 | Stored in Docker repositories (e.g., Docker Hub).                          | Stored on the host machine, created from an image.                              |
 | Cannot be changed once created.                                            | Can be modified while running (e.g., writing files).                            |
 | `nginx`, `ubuntu`, `node` (as images in a registry).                       | A running instance of `nginx` or `ubuntu` container.                            |
 | `docker pull <image_name>`                                                 | `docker run -d <image_name>`                                                    |

### **Summary**:
- **Docker Image**: A **static template** for creating containers.
- **Docker Container**: A **dynamic, running instance** of an image.

# 27. How to Copy Files from a Running Container to the Host.?
To copy files from a running Docker container to the host system, you can use the `docker cp` command.

**Command:-**  `docker cp <container_id>:<path_to_file_inside_container> <path_on_host>`

   - **`<container_id>`**: The ID or name of the running container.
   - **`<path_to_file_inside_container>`**: The file or directory inside the container you want to copy.
   - **`<path_on_host>`**: The destination path on your host machine where the file will be copied.
       
**Example**: If you want to copy a file called `example.txt` from the container `/app` directory to the `/home/user/` directory on the host, you would use:
```bash
docker cp <container_id>:/app/example.txt /home/user/
```
**Example with Container Name**:
```bash
docker cp my_container:/app/example.txt /home/user/
```

# 28. How to Expose a Container's Port to the Host?
To expose a container’s port to the host, you use the **-p** or **--publish flag** with the docker run command. This binds a container’s internal port to a port on the host machine, allowing external access.

```bash
docker run -p <host_port>:<container_port> <image_name>

docker run -p 8080:80 nginx
```
- If you want to expose port 80 of the container to port 8080 on the host machine, you would run and you can access the Nginx web server by visiting `http://localhost:8080` in a web browser.

**If your container exposes multiple ports, you can bind multiple ports:** `docker run -p 8080:80 -p 443:443 <image_name>`
